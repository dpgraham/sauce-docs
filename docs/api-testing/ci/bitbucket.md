:::info yaml validation
If you're having trouble with the `.yml` syntax, it's recommended to use a free online YAML/JSON validator tool like these:
* [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/)
* [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator)
* [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator)

There are also various IDE Plugins that can perform syntax checks and/or auto-completion:

* [JetBrains YAML Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13126-yaml)
* [VSCode YAML Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
* [Atom YAML Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-yaml)
